#variables in python



#we can declare a variable by assign a value to it...
x=10   #x is a varibles which holds value 10  and is type is int
print(x)  #value of x will be print

x='10' #value of x will be overwrite by '10' and type is str
print(x)

x=10.0 #value of x will be overwrite by 10.0 and type is double
print(x)

#we can give explicit the data type to a varible by casting

x=str (10)  #value of x is str type 
print(x)

x=int(20.0)   #value of x will be int type
print(x)

x=float (30)#value of x will be float type
print (x)

#we also get the datatype of any varible by using type()

x=10
print(type(x))
x='manish'
print(type(x))

#we also get for others 

#tata see you in the next program
