txt="hello python users"

print(txt.capitalize())  #make the first character have upper case and the rest lower case.
print(txt.casefold())  #Return a version of the string suitable for caseless comparisons or simple in lower case

print(txt.encode())

#strings concatenation

#let we have 2 strings x and y
x='hello'
y='manish'
print(x+y)

#we also give the space between using ''
print(x+" "+y)

#Also we know that , we can not concatenate string and number , for example
age=20
#print(x+" "+y+" "+age)   #give me error something like this, TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
#don't worry we have a method format(), by this we can concatenate str and int but we have to places the curley bracket where we have to add
# let do it

y='manish age {}'
print(x+ y.format(age))

#format method take unlimited methods something like that
y='manish age {} height {} number {}'
height=5.9
number=8

y='manish age {} height {} number {}'
print(x+y.format(age,height,number)) #we goona do something like thatüòÄ



#tata see in the next program üòÅ
